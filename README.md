### Important Info: 

- yfinance API has had issues lately with updates; as such, upon installation if you experience an errors fetching tickers that you are positive have not been delisted, 
pip install a prior version of finance, using the following command: 'pip install yfinance==0.1.63'

- this script is meant to run locally and securely. however, functionality has been put in place to allow for PushBullet API to execute automatically if desired. 
As such, incorporate this feature if you would like using your own custom-generated API key here: https://docs.pushbullet.com/
